    <h1>How to Play Book of Mormon Baseball</h1>
    <p>It's pretty simple: </p>
    <p>A random scripture from the Book of Mormon is given. 
    Guess the correct book and chapter the verse is found in within 3 tries. 
    For each verse you guess correctly, a point is added to your score. </p>

    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>Book of Mormon Baseball has been a favorite of scholars, missionaries, and computer scientists for years.
    Now, the game of their dreams can be found on the web thanks to the generous support of the church's 
    official sponsors: Deseret Book, Mutual (the app), and Dasani.</p>
